Methods:

The method was clearly described.  There was limited mention of preprocessing. The choice of how the image was represented in the prediction model was briefly described and justified. The structure and training procedure of the prediction model was well explained and hyper-parameter choices were described. There was some evidence of background reading and consultation of course notes.

Analysis:

The analysis of results was well described. There was evidence of well reasoned experimentation and exploration, but it could have been more systematic and better quantified. Detailed quantative analysis was performed with good use of plots and appropriate metrics. Detailed qualitative analysis was performed. Identifying systematic failures and illustration of good examples with well reasoned explanations.

Extension:

The extension task is well described using just text.  A reasonable approach to incoproating the additional data that contains only a few landmarks was provided with some justification. Extension task results show a reasonable benefit. 

Misc:

The code was well documented. The report was well written. Diagrams, graphs and example predictions are very clear, informative and correctly labelled. The report was well referenced.

Well written report, however it was too long. Some missing references. MSE and r-squared of 0.0 and 1 respectively is unrealistic.
